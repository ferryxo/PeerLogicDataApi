<h1> The data warehouse REST APIs</h1>
<pre>
    These APIs allow developers to query data using a RESTful interface. The initial version of the APIs allow you to retrieve data from the following tables :
    - Artifact
    - Criteria
    - Critique
    - EvalMode
    - Tasks


Artifact
    This table stores metadata of the work that is submitted and to be peer reviewed
    This table has five columns, including:
    - content: contains the content of this artifact, when available

Filtering Data
    - Each REST API returns paginated data. The default paging is set to 30 records. this can be changed by passing request arguments in the URL
      e.g.,: ?page=1&amp;pagelength=10, request page 1 of the data
    - Moreover, the API also support ordering the data based on a column in the table.
      e.g.,: ?orderby=id&amp;order=desc
    - The API also allows filtering columns with greater (gt), less than(lt), greater or equal than(gte), less or equal than(lte)
      e.g.,:
       - Integer datatype --> http://127.0.0.1:5000/critiques/score?gte=1&amp;lte=2
       - Date datatype --> http://127.0.0.1:5000/tasks/start?gte=2016-01-01 00:00&amp;lte=2016-01-31 23:59&amp;orderby=starts_at
